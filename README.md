## 🚀 Quick Start

Credentials:
  User: `admin`
  Password: `ChangeMe123!`

<details>
  <summary><h3>1. Clone, Install & Run(click to expand)</h3></summary>

  *(prerequisite: Node.js 18+)*
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paoloronco/Lynx.git
    cd Lynx
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..
    npm run start
  ```

> Public → http://localhost:3001

> Admin → http://localhost:3001/admin
HTTPS (optional) → https://localhost:8443
 (requires ENABLE_HTTPS=true)
</details>


<details>
  <summary><h3>2. 🚀 Deploy with Docker</h3></summary>

You can run **Lynx** directly using the pre-built image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paueron/lynx).

1. Pull the image
    ```bash
    docker pull paueron/lynx:latest
    ```
2. Start the container
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name lynx \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      -p 8443:8443 \
      -e NODE_ENV=production \
      -e PORT=8080 \
      -e JWT_SECRET="your-very-secret-key" \
      -e ENABLE_HTTPS=true \
      -v lynx_data:/app/server \
      paueron/lynx:latest
    ```
    > ⚠️ Since version v3.5.0, the container requires a JWT_SECRET to start.
    If it’s missing, startup will fail with an error message to prevent insecure sessions.

    Once started, the app will be available at:
    > 🌐 HTTP → http://localhost:8080
    > 🔒 HTTPS → https://localhost:8443
      (self-signed certificate)

    > 👉 http://localhost:8080/admin

3. Optional environment variables
    - JWT_SECRET – secret key used to sign JWT tokens. If not set, a random key will be generated at runtime (⚠️ highly recommended to set this in production).

    - PORT – the internal server port (default: 8080).

    - NODE_ENV – Node.js environment (default: production).

## 📝 Changelog

### v3.5.1

#### 🔒 Security Updates
* **All security vulnerabilities resolved**
  - Fixed all runtime vulnerabilities (multer, express, react-router-dom)
  - Fixed all build-time vulnerabilities (tar, minimatch, glob, cross-spawn)
  - Updated system packages in Docker images
  - Security audit: 0 vulnerabilities detected in frontend & backend
  - Resolves GitHub Dependabot alerts #18-36 and all DockerHub CVEs

#### 🚀 Performance
* **Docker build optimization**
  - Build time reduced from 18+ minutes to ~2 seconds
  - Removed `--build-from-source` flag for faster npm installations
  - Uses precompiled binaries for better reliability

#### 🔧 Improvements
* Added `.claude/` to `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`
* Set `PORT=8080` environment variable in Docker for consistency
* Updated `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive security information

### v3.5.0

### 🔧 Admin
* Updated title to: “Lynx – Your personal links hub”
* **Profile**
  - Bio now supports **line breaks** (`whitespace-pre-line`)
  - Empty bio is automatically hidden (no blank space left)
  - Social links are hidden when empty
  - Profile picture now displays correctly
* **Links**
  - Consistent text color applied across title, description, and URL
  - Improved Text Card rendering: Link name on the first line, URL on the second line (with horizontal scroll for long URLs)
  - Added support for image/emoji next to links
  - Added ability to insert either: 
    * Text Card → full card with only text, entire card clickable via a single link
    * Bulleted List → list with a title and multiple links underneath
  - Option to export/import links as JSON
  - Bug fixes in rendering icons, removing cards, and updating links
  - Fixed bugs with icons, card removal, and link updates
  - Extended customization: choose font, size, and alignment for links
* **Theme**
  - Removed duplicate “Content” tab (was redundant with name + bio)
  - Partially removed Typography tab → now integrated into Links and Profile sections for better UX
  - Export/Import now properly saves and restores themes
* **UI**
  - Updated footer to:
    `Powered by Lynx | Lynx - Your personal links hub`
  - Possibility to change the `title` and `meta description`
* **Docker / Deployment**
  - Added startup check for JWT_SECRET:
    the container will now fail to start if the environment variable JWT_SECRET is missing.
    This ensures proper JWT token signing and prevents session invalidation on restart.
    Example usage:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e JWT_SECRET="your-strong-random-secret" paueron/lynx:latest
    ```
  - **Built-in HTTPS support** → enable automatic SSL (self-signed) by setting `ENABLE_HTTPS=true`, runs alongside HTTP on port `8443`.

## 📌 To-Do / Next Steps
